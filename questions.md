1. What is the difference between Component and PureComponent?
Give an example where it might break my app.

Normal components re-render when their parent component renders or there is a 
state update. Pure components only render when it's necessary.

It can break if the props have deeply nested objects (because of only shallow comparison).


2. Context + ShouldComponentUpdate might be dangerous. Why is
that?

ContextAPI provides a state for the app. But ShouldComponentUpdate observes the props instead of the state.
So it re-renders based on a prop change, not a state change.
This might lead to an issue that it ignores the state change.


3. Describe 3 ways to pass information from a component to its
PARENT.

1- Context API
2- UseReducer 
3- State management libraries like Redux (signals is getting popularity nowadays)


4. Give 2 ways to prevent components from re-rendering.

1 -Using memo is one of the best as it prevents re-rendering when their props have not changed.
2 - useCallback: memoizes the function

5. What is a fragment and why do we need it? Give an example where it
might break my app.

It's this pattern we usually use for wrapping our JSX into a parent: <></>
We need it because sometimes we don't want to add an extra element to the DOM as it my break the CSS styling.



6. Give 3 examples of the HOC pattern.
7. What's the difference in handling exceptions in promises,
callbacks and asyncâ€¦await?
8. How many arguments does setState take and why is it async.
9. List the steps needed to migrate a Class to Function
Component.
10. List a few ways styles can be used with components.
11. How to render an HTML string coming from the server.
