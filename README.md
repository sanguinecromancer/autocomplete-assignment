Hello! This is Zeynep :)

Starting the project:

npm install

npm run dev


In this project I'm using an API that serves cartoon characters of Rick and Morty. (892 items, cartoon characters)

CSS: I have a generic file that I take from project to project, so I didn't write too much CSS for this, no worries

Performance:

For performance I didn't make use of external libraries but used React's suspense and lazy.
And then for debouncing I made a custom function (not from lodash).

Test: Testing wasn't mentioned but I still wanted to add at least one - I also didn't install a library, I am using native Node.JS Test Runner.
but Node.js 18 or newer is needed to use the built-in test runner.


Accessibility:
I tried to add aria labels for accessibility compliance.
