Hello! This is Zeynep :)

Starting the project:

npm install

npm run dev


In this project I'm using an API that serves cartoon characters of Rick and Morty. (892 characters)

CSS: I have a generic file that I take from project to project, so I didn't write too much CSS for this, no worries

Performance:

For performance I didn't make use of external libraries but used React's suspense and lazy.
And then for debouncing I made a custom function (not from lodash).

Test:


Accessibility:
I tried to add aria labels for accessibility complience
